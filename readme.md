In this project we have made website using django framework of python to not only help the rural women but everyone else who faces the problem of keeping records of their savings and expeditures.
In this website we have a static part filled with important guidelines for investment options and tricks and tips. We also have shown how to use EFT shares so that people can invest even if they have very less amount of money like < Rs.500. 

We also have built a free account service by which users can keep track of all the savings and expenditures that they have done and see the variation and percentage of the money spent or saved. We also provide varying investment options based on the total money saved and money that can be safely invested.

This website is fraud proof as it secures the user data effectively and also give safe investment options to its users.

We have used a ML model to automate the tracker as most of the people in rural areas are not well educated. This model will help them to interact with our website easily.
It will convert the voice into text. Basically we have created a Voice-to-Text engine using ML.

Using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence we are not only automating the process but we are revolutionising the mind-set of the people.
